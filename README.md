# MaxSubarray Complexity Calculation

This repository contains Python code for calculating the complexity of finding the maximum subarray in an array. 
The objective is to analyze and implement algorithms to solve the "Maximum Subarray Problem," a key concept in computer science and algorithms.
Created as a project in the algorithms and data structures class of the university of patras




## Introduction

The Maximum Subarray Problem involves finding the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest sum. T

This repository   explores the complexity and performance of different approaches for solving the problem.



### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lampros2003/maxsubarray_complexity_calculation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd maxsubarray_complexity_calculation
   ```

## Usage

Run the Python scripts to test the algorithms:

```bash
python solution.py
```


## Algorithms Covered

- **Kadane's Algorithm**: An efficient O(n) solution for finding the maximum subarray.
